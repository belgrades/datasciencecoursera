===================
Update for Machine Learning
Download html and folder with images. It will work in your browser (no need to compile .Rmd)
=======
I made a mistake and I have 2 assignments in this repository.

If youre from Developing Data Products just see ui.R and server.R
If you're from machine learning open the html.

Sorry and thanks in advance.
